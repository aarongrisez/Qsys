# Initial Setup:

Hamiltonians = [[0, .5],
               [.5, 0]]
Initial State = [[1/sqrt(2)],
		 [1/sqrt(2)]]
POVMs = [[[.3,0],
          [0,.7]],
         [[.7,0],
          [0,.3]]]
delta_t = .01

# Basic Tests:

test_run_one_step():
    Internal State after 1 run:
	[[0.70709794-0.00353552j],
	 [0.70709794-0.00353552j]])

    Should have produced the propogator (after exponentiating):
        [[0.9999875+0.j        , 0.       -0.00499998j],
         [0.       -0.00499998j, 0.9999875+0.j        ]]
