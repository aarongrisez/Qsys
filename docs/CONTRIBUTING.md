### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: cold, hard, coding power needed here. If you're a language guru, this is for you
- **documentation-needed**: Needs more Comments! Needs more Examples. NEEDS. MORE. COWBELL.
- **bug-high-priority**: okay, something broke and it's pretty bad; heeeeelpppppp
- **bug-low-priority**: okay, something broke but it isn't all that bad, we can kind of ignore it, but not for too long
- **source-qa-needed**: something is out of place, inefficient, or just plain looks wrong. We always want to improve workflow!
- **help-wanted**: one of these is happening: :confounded: :sob: :tired_face:

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
